# PractMachProj_Coursera

This repository contains files created for the Coursera Practical Machining Course from Johns Hopkins University. These files
contain code and pdf report for the final project.

If you don't want to download the repo to view the .html file, I have knitted a .pdf copy that *should* be viewable by clicking on it.
